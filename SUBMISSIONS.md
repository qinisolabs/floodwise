# floodwise — directory submissions

Glama and mcp.so auto-ingest from it.

## Notes

- floodwise is an **England**, area-level, long-term flood-risk lookup over open Environment Agency data
  (OGL v3.0). Lead listings with those limits — it is not insurance/underwriting/property-level advice.
- Description (≤100 chars): *England flood-risk by postcode for AI agents — verified Environment Agency data, not guesses.*
- No API keys, stateless, stdio/npx.
